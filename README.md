# my-first-website-RWD
"Restaurant": My first website project created in HTML5 and CSS3. The project presents the start page and the contact page of a "fictional" restaurant. It is fully responsive when it comes to mobile devices, tablets (medium devices) and desktops. The project was inspired by a workshop that I did as part of the CSS course from the "strefa.kurs√≥w.pl" platform
